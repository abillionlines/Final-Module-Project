## Brian Wilkinson -- Coding Temple -- Final Module Project

## About -------

This is a rebuild of a Personal Portfolio Template found on Figma to complete the HTML and CSS study at Coding Temple.

here is the link to the original design:

## Challenges -----

the hardest part about this design was my commitment in mixing all postioning methods...position relative, absolute, justify-conent etc.

The information I was able to pull from the original designn was that of a mostly block and inline display elements. I worked to add a lot of flex funcitonality.

It was also very difficult towards the ned as I relized that the many viewer width values I had put in the code made it very difficult to format it for extra large screens. I had to go back and reformat alot of it to make sure I could add a max width to the site.

## Setup ----

All assets are included in the folder. Fonts are linked in the HTML and CSS.

I seperated the CSS into multiple files..corresponding to the different sections of the site. one for base/reset properties and then seperate files for each section.

the site is live at https://abillionlines.github.io

the sites code can be reviewed at https://github.com/abillionlines/Final-Module-Project
